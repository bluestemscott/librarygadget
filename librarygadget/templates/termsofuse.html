<h3>Terms of Use</h3>

<p> Library Gadget is a personal check-out library information monitoring tool 
developed and maintained by Bluestem Innovation. While the Library Gadget Website 
and Services are available for use by anyone who signs up as an Library Gadget 
user, there are some rules and guidelines you must adhere to when using 
any or all of our services. Please make yourself familiar with the 
guidelines provided in our Terms of Use before proceeding, as by using 
this site and associated services, you are agreeing to our Privacy 
Policy and Terms of Use. 
</p>

<p>
This Terms of Use document explains the terms and conditions governing 
your use of the Library Gadget Website and Services ("Library Gadget", "Service"). By signing 
up for a Library Gadget account and by using any Service, you are indicating you 
agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree 
with any of these terms, please exit this site and do not use or sign up 
for Library Gadget.  
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Library Gadget is an Internet-based tool for individuals to check and obtain 
information from their library accounts. If you use Library Gadget, you are able to 
check every library account you are personally responsible for in one 
place. You could also receive email 
alerts before library items are due, when items are overdue, and when items have been
automatically renewed for you. 
</p>

<h3>Use of the Service</h3>
<p>
By completing the sign up process to become a user ("User") of the 
Service or by providing information to us in any other manner, you agree 
to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information on all 
registration pages. Submitting false information will result in 
termination of your account. You agree that we may use the information 
you provide to us according to the Privacy Policy on this site. 
</p>

<p>
If you become a user of the Service, you agree to accept responsibility 
for all activities that occur under your account or password, and agree 
you will not sell, transfer or assign your membership (user account) or 
any associated rights therein. You are responsible for maintaining the 
confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your 
computer so that others may not access the Library Gadget website using your name 
in whole or in part. 
</p>

<p>
The library cards that you are asking us to monitor must be your own 
personal cards or library cards for which you have received permission 
to monitor or library cards for which you are responsible for (usually 
children 13 years or under). By using Library Gadget, you agree and give us 
permission to act on your behalf when we log into your library account, 
to obtain and retrieve account information and to display this 
information for you, just as you might or could do in person. You agree 
to use Library Gadget only for legal purposes and for your own personal and 
non-commercial use. 
</p>

<p>
You agree and accept that you are responsible for all the materials 
borrowed on the cards we are monitoring and for any charges on items 
that are overdue, lost or damaged. 
</p>

<p>
We reserve the right to terminate membership if individuals from more 
than one household access the Service using any single user name or 
password. If you believe someone has accessed the Service using your 
Account ID and password without your authorization, email us 
immediately. 
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
As we do not allow unidentified access and must be able to verify who 
you are, you must enable cookies. You also warrant that you are not 
pretending to be another person or purporting to represent an 
organization that you are not officially connected with.  
</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>
We won't use your personal details for any reason other than to fulfill your request, 
send email alerts or service updates. We won't disclose personal details to a third party 
unless you explicitly initiate the action (for example, by clicking a link to share a library item on Facebook) 
or unless ordered to do so by a court.
